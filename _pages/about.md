I recently completed a PhD in physical chemistry at the University of Oxford (2021-25) under the supervision of [Prof. Susan Perkin](https://perkin.web.ox.ac.uk/), generously funded by a Clarendon Scholarship. Previously, I graduated with a first-class degree in Natural Sciences (Chemistry) from the University of Cambridge (2017-21).

My doctoral research focused on investigating interactions and structures in aqueous solutions containing small molecules accumulated in biological cytosol. I used an instrument called the Surface Force Balance (SFB) to measure interactions between two charged surfaces across solutions of interest, with sub-nanometre resolution. Additionally, I performed neutron and X-ray scattering measurements to investigate the bulk structure of these solutions. This work helps us to better understand the toolbox of structures and interactions available in natural systems to maintain cellular functionality.
